- The Portfolio section is done with mock data, and should replaced by purchased planets
- React Component Tests - There should be a test file in each of the component folder
- Storybook - There should be a storybook file to build up component style library  within each of the component folder
- Styling - Better styling in general (to get rid of white space)
